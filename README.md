# Test-Builders Workshop 

Developers working on legacy code are always told to write tests before fixing 
any bug.  
In theory, it is very nice, but in practice, it is a lot more tricky!

We know we need to add tests, but itâ€™s easier said than done.  
In legacy codebase, just setting up the objects for the test is most often an 
unjustifiable nightmarish 2 weeks work. Mocks are a common workaround, but 
mocking legacy codebase usually makes them more difficult to change, not less!

In this hands-on pair programming dojo, you will learn how to combine the 
mikado method with test-data-builders to build a baby-step plan to add your
first test to a legacy codebase. You will also learn how to draw a graph of
nested test-data-builders so that you can instantiate test data, without mocks.

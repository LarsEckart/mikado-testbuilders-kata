### 2 - Easy Fix, Difficult Test

| The good                   | The bad                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| We managed to fix and test | We see a lot of duplication in the tests     |
|                            | Tests took more time to write than the fixes |

How would these problems become in the legacy code base you deal with everyday?
What took so long about adding the test?
What could we do against these problems?

### 3 - Building Test Data

| The good                  | The bad                                       |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Tests are more readable   | Writing the test data builders is even slower |
| Less duplication in tests | Not sure how to apply this in other codebases |

How would these problems become in the legacy code base you deal with everyday?
What could we do against these problems?

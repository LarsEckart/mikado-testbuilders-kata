That's all folks!

## Other Takeaways and important points

Test Data Builders and the Mikado Method are only some of the legacy-
refactoring techniques out there:

* Golden Master Testing (or Approval Testing)
* Strangler application
* Bubble Context (or Anti-Corruption Layer extraction)
 
We can combine most of them as we did today. These combinations are more
powerful than the each technique separately. This is the case where 

> 1 + 1 > 2

When we started to coach teams about refactoring, experience had taught us that
that legacy code bases had to go through a long and painful refactoring phase 
before we could apply agile-coding practices like TDD.

We are now convinced that it is possible to jump into TDD much faster, in 
almost any code base, as long as you learn the skills.

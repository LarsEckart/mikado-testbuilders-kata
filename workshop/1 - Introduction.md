# Introduction

## Turn and Talk Energizer

You'll need to collaborate a lot during this workshop, so let's get started
with an activity that will get you to know each other.

> Introduce yourself to a person seated next to you. Tell this person why you
> are here and what you want to learn from this workshop.

## Organization of this workshop

During this workshop, you'll first fix a bug in an existing, untested app and
try to add unit tests at the same time.

As this should prove difficult, we'll present how to combine 2 techniques, test
data builders and the mikado method, to add tests without stopping feature
delivery.

You'll be programming in pairs for most of the workshop.

You'll find links to 'Web Centers': web pages containing documentation and
references to important concepts in this workshop. If you are in a room, there
might also be 'Wall Centers' on the wall were you'll find similar information
and physical books.
